# Fibonacci-Series
Generating Fibonacci numbers recursively or iteratively in C#

We used two approaches in generating  Fibonacci numbers;

Case 1 (Iterative Approach): This approach is the simplest and quickest way to generate the sequence of Fibonacci Numbers.

Case 2 (Recursive Approach): In this approach, we use recursion to process the sequence of numbers. We need to pass the 
length of the Fibonacci Series to the recursive method and then it iterates continuously until it reaches the goal.
